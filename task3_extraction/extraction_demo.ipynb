    "# Task 3: Language to Structure - Knowledge Extraction Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a hybrid pipeline for extracting structured business rules from natural language inputs and mapping them to the Circonomit Block-Attribute model from Task 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hybrid Pipeline:**\n",
    "- **Rule templates** for high-confidence IF-THEN patterns\n",
    "- **LLM extraction** (GPT-4) for flexible language understanding  \n",
    "- **Pydantic validation** for schema compliance\n",
    "- **Graph mapping** to Block-Attribute relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll extract knowledge from these three business rule examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"If energy costs rise above €200/MWh, we will postpone production by one week.\"\n",
    "2. \"Demand in France drops by 60% at a price above €250 per unit.\"  \n",
    "3. \"If we can't deliver for two weeks, there's an 80% chance we'll lose the customer.\"\n"
